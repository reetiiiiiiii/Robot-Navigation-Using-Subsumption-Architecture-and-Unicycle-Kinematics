# Robot-Navigation-Using-Subsumption-Architecture-and-Unicycle-Kinematics
Developed an autonomous robot in MATLAB using Subsumption Architecture for layered behaviors: obstacle avoidance, random wandering &amp; goal-seeking. Implemented Unicycle Kinematics and simulated navigation in 2D obstacles, enabling efficient path planning and real-time decision-making.
